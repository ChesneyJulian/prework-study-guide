# Chesney's Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This application was built to help organize study information for the coding bootcamp prework course. This webpage was built to make important information regarding HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript concise and easily reviewed on a singular page. It also contains links to outside sources that provide additional information on the subject matter. This solves the problem of having to sort through a vast amount of resources when looking to refresh your memory on the key points covered in the prework course. While building this webpage, I learned how to join HTML files, external style sheets, and javascript files to create a webpage that includes content, style, and functionality. I learned the importance of Gitflow and debugging while adding more information to the project.
